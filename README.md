## Project info

This was made as a small school project. We wanted too learn something new so we started of with Vue, a framework that has good recomendations. The project plan was to setting up a workflow from start to deploy.

> Start - For an effective way for setting up a nice structure and orginize your maps and files we choose Vue-CLI for scaffolding.
That included: Webpack, ESlint, Jest, Vue-Router.

> Develop - SASS, JavaScript, Vue, ESlint

> Test - Jest For TDD ( Test Driven Development )

> Intergrate - GitHub, Create a new branch for every sucessfull function and push it upp.

> Optimize - Vue-CLI comes with with a nice setup with build tool. build for production with minification, just npm run build.

> Deploy
